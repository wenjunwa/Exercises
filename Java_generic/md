Generics: 
	to create one class that takes in diffrent types of variable. 
	This avoids creating duplicated code that did the same thing. the only thing that changes is the variable type they operate on.
	the variable that passed in as a generic type has to be an object type.
	can not be an primitive type(int, double, char)
	a generic class can operate on multiple variable type

Benefit:
generics: allowed us to utilize code reusability. (we don't need a class for each variable type that we need to use)

bounded types bounded generic type to something.
	eg. <T extends Number>

wildcard: <?> unbounded wildcard
	  <? extends T> bounded wildcard
	  <? super T> lower bouned wildcard
