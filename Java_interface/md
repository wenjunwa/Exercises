Interface: 
completely separate interface(what to implement) fromt impletation(how to implement).
	an interface can be implemented by any number of classes. 
	a class can implement multiple number of interfaces, 
	a class can extends a parent calss while can also implement multiple interfaces at the same time.

Inference referrence variables: 
	create a variable of an interface type
	this variable can inferrence the objects that implement that interface
	this variable can only call the methods of the object that is defined in the interface

Variables can be declared in an interface:
	variables in an interface is static, they can be call by interface name
	variables in an interface is public, any class that implement that variable can access it
	variables in an interface is finnal, which can not be changed.

An interface can be extended:
	body of the methods can be defined inside of the interface
	the classes that implement the sub_interface of an interface can access the variable of the (parent) interface

default methods: 
	the body of a method of an interface can be implemented in the interface
	an object of a class that implements the interface can call the default method.
	an class can override the methods of the interface it implements

static method in an interface:
	we can call static methods of an interface without creating objects of classes that implement the interface

private methods within interface:
	an private method within an interface can be call by an default method of the interface
	an object of class that implement an interface indirectly invoke an private method of the interface if the private method is called in an default method of the interface.
